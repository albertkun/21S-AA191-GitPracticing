## Plugin Review
Group|Tool|Comments|Example
-----|----|--------|----------------------
Migration Justice  | Sleep | This would be really helpful if our map was centered in our website but since it isn't then I don't think we will use it as it require substantial revision of our page design. I would recomment it to those with bigger maps | N/A |
Against Asian Hate | 
Mental Health Group | 
SEA Admit Tours |
Food Distribution Project | Leaflet Control Window | This is a very useful feature that we believe can allow us to better introduce our project goals and improve navigation for our users. It's really cool that you can modify the HTML within the window, making it easier to edit what's being displayed. We may add a button to our page that will allow users to revisit the popup if they would like to. | 
LA Tenants Survey |
Reimagining 6th Street | Leaflet Sleep | The first implementation has been wonky, we're trying to fix it! But we think this will be an extremely helpful tool in making sure our map stays fixed on the boundary of Koreatown. This tool will be applied in tandem with the button Albert suggested we implement at the bottom to zoom out to all submissions. | https://lvalles10.github.io/Transportation-Group/Reimagining_6th/index.html
